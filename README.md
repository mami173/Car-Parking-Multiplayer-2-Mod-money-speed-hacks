Car Parking Multiplayer 2 Mod menu unlimited money and coins with speed HACKS - One thing that sets car off-road racing apart from other types of races is how it goes against intuition. Although in most types of races, the straight is where drivers typically drive on easy streets and have plenty of room to overtake other drivers and increase their speed, this is not the case for CPM2. In fact, you will notice that it is the straight surfaces, mainly those downhill surfaces, that appear difficult to navigate. The forward/backward tilt button and backward tilt button are not just about sliding your finger from left to right. Firstly, you need to do it slowly and pay attention to the motorcycle icon on the accelerator pedal - if the icon moves forward as you slide from left to right, you will know that you have done the right thing.
